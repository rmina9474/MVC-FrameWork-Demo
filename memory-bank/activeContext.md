3. **Payment Flow**: Ensuring robust error handling and user experience for all payment scenarios
4. **Routing Strategy**: Using explicit route attributes for payment callbacks
5. **Source Control**: Maintaining comprehensive .gitignore file
6. **UI/UX Strategy**: Continuing UI modernization with card-based designs and consistent visual language
7. **Error Handling**: Implementing defensive coding practices with null checks and proper exception handling
8. **Form Validation**: Simplifying and improving validation with consistent error messaging
9. **Product Catalog**: Optimizing product attributes and enhancing display options
10. **Database Schema**: Managing migrations carefully
11. **Containerization**: Finalizing Docker setup for deployment
12. **CSS Animation**: Enhancing UI feedback with subtle animations
13. **View Consistency**: Ensuring all required views are implemented and properly referenced
14. **Localization**: Standardizing on VND currency format throughout the application
15. **View Resolution**: Implementing proper controller redirection patterns for shared views

## Current Challenges

- Maintaining consistent button terminology and functionality throughout the UI
- Ensuring secure session management across the application
- Improving payment error handling and user experience
- Optimizing product search and filtering capabilities
- Maintaining proper null checking and error handling
- Ensuring proper form validation with helpful error messages
- Managing database migrations without disrupting existing data
- Balancing features with stability and performance
- Maintaining consistent UI behavior across all device sizes
- Resolving any remaining missing view errors
- Ensuring consistent price formatting across all views
- Validating proper route configuration for all controller actions
- Verifying that all controller actions have corresponding views in the expected locations
- Addressing view resolution issues when the same view is accessed from multiple controllers

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term Tasks**:

   - Verify all controller actions have corresponding views
   - Ensure consistent "Order" button functionality and styling
   - Review any remaining "Add to Cart" references in the codebase
   - Implement comprehensive session security across all areas
   - Enhance payment error handling for all methods
   - Continue UI modernization with consistent visual language
   - Implement comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
   - Complete product catalog enhancements
   - Optimize database queries for performance
   - Enhance Docker configuration for production deployment
   - Update documentation with latest changes
   - Ensure all prices display consistently in VND format
   - Implement proper controller-to-controller redirection for shared views

2. **Medium-term Goals**:

   - Apply consistent UI modernization across all pages
   - Implement advanced search with filtering options
   - Add recommendation system based on purchase history
   - Enhance analytics capabilities for store performance
   - Consider multi-currency support for international customers
   - Improve mobile experience with touch-optimized interfaces
